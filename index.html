            <h2>Biography: </h2>
            <div>
                <p>I currently work in the Digital Services department for the Somerset County Library System (SCLS). My primary role is finding
                    and maintaining open source alternatives to many of the softwares we use to manage our libraries digital infrastructure.
                    I'm familiar with Linux systems as well as system virtualization and cloud implementation. Before going to school for IT I earned a 
                    bachelors in Fine Art and painting. After art school I took up restaurant work where I learned how to be a sushi chef, a career I was in for 5 years
                    and would still be in had the restaurant I was working in not been closed due to the pandemic. Outside of work I mainly spend my time playing videogames,
                    drawing/painting, working on my car, and with my cat Maurice.
                </p>
                <p>My hope is to one day work in an IT department of a major corporation as a systems admin/network tech. I'm still relatively new to coding, but have grown
                    up around computers and find myself picking these skills up quickly. Since starting this course I've been able to apply my newly learned skills
                    to real world problems and have even been put on the team responsible for updating SCLS's new website redesign. The more I learn about coding and networking 
                    the more I am fascinated by all things digital. It's an evergrowing field that I hope to eventually find myself actively contributing to. 
                    Thanks for visiting my page!

            <h2>An Excerpt from Dracula</h2>

            <div>
                <p>When I described Lucy's symptoms--the same as before, but infinitely more marked--he looked very grave, but said nothing. He took with him a bag in which were many instruments and drugs, "the ghastly paraphernalia of our beneficial trade," as he once called, in one of his lectures, the equipment of a professor of the healing craft. When we were shown in, Mrs. Westenra met us. She was alarmed, but not nearly so much as I expected to find her. Nature in one of her beneficent moods has ordained that even death has some antidote to its own terrors. Here, in a case where any shock may prove fatal, matters are so ordered that, from some cause or other, the things not personal--even the terrible change in her daughter to whom she is so attached--do not seem to reach her. It is something like the way Dame Nature gathers round a foreign body an envelope of some insensitive tissue which can protect from evil that which it would otherwise harm by contact. If this be an ordered selfishness, then we should pause before we condemn any one for the vice of egoism, for there may be deeper root for its causes than we have knowledge of.</p>

                <p>I used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology, and laid down a rule that she should not be present with Lucy or think of her illness more than was absolutely required. She assented readily, so readily that I saw again the hand of Nature fighting for life. Van Helsing and I were shown up to Lucy's room. If I was shocked when I saw her yesterday, I was horrified when I saw her to-day. She was ghastly, chalkily pale; the red seemed to have gone even from her lips and gums, and the bones of her face stood out prominently; her breathing was painful to see or hear. Van Helsing's face grew set as marble, and his eyebrows converged till they almost touched over his nose. Lucy lay motionless, and did not seem to have strength to speak, so for a while we were all silent. Then Van Helsing beckoned to me, and we went gently out of the room. The instant we had closed the door he stepped quickly along the passage to the next door, which was open. Then he pulled me quickly in with him and closed the door. "My God!" he said; "this is dreadful. There is no time to be lost. She will die for sheer want of blood to keep the heart's action as it should be. There must be transfusion of blood at once. Is it you or me?"</p>
                
                <p>"I am younger and stronger, Professor. It must be me."</p>
                
                <p>"Then get ready at once. I will bring up my bag. I am prepared."</p>
                
                <p>I went downstairs with him, and as we were going there was a knock at the hall-door. When we reached the hall the maid had just opened the door, and Arthur was stepping quickly in. He rushed up to me, saying in an eager whisper:--</p>
                
                <p>"Jack, I was so anxious. I read between the lines of your letter, and have been in an agony. The dad was better, so I ran down here to see for myself. Is not that gentleman Dr. Van Helsing? I am so thankful to you, sir, for coming." When first the Professor's eye had lit upon him he had been angry at his interruption at such a time; but now, as he took in his stalwart proportions and recognised the strong young manhood which seemed to emanate from him, his eyes gleamed. Without a pause he said to him gravely as he held out his hand:--</p>
