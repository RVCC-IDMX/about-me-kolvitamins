            <h2>Biography: </h2>
            <div>
                <p>I currently work in the Digital Services department for the Somerset County Library System (SCLS). My primary role is finding
                    and maintaining open source alternatives to many of the softwares we use to manage our libraries digital infrastructure.
                    I'm familiar with Linux systems as well as system virtualization and cloud implementation. Before going to school for IT I earned a 
                    bachelors in Fine Art and painting. After art school I took up restaurant work where I learned how to be a sushi chef, a career I was in for 5 years
                    and would still be in had the restaurant I was working in not been closed due to the pandemic. Outside of work I mainly spend my time playing videogames,
                    drawing/painting, working on my car, and with my cat Maurice.
                </p>
                <p>My hope is to one day work in an IT department of a major corporation as a systems admin/network tech. I'm still relatively new to coding, but have grown
                    up around computers and find myself picking these skills up quickly. Since starting this course I've been able to apply my newly learned skills
                    to real world problems and have even been put on the team responsible for updating SCLS's new website redesign. The more I learn about coding and networking 
                    the more I am fascinated by all things digital. It's an evergrowing field that I hope to eventually find myself actively contributing to. 
                </p>

            <h2>CSS Animation</h2>

            <div>
                <p> When I was in art school I took a class on traditional pen and paper animation. 
                    Animating at 12 frames per second meant that I would be spending countless hours in the animation studio drawing hundreds of images for each project. 
                    The professors for my other classes would ask us if we were taking any animation courses since they knew these courses demanded more time than any other course.
                    Luckily for web developers animation is much simpler and requires only a few lines of code to achieve what would take hours to hand animate. In CSS animation is primarily done through 2 properties, animation and transition. 
                </p>

                <p>Transition is the easier to use property of the two. This property has 4 main sub-properties: delay, duration, property and timing-function. 
                    In the below animation I used the transition property to move the red square from one side of the box to the other side when hovered over. 
                    This animation is composed of 3 selectors: the "parent", the "child" and the "parent:hover child".
                    In the 3rd selector, "the parent: hover child", the "child" selector is translated 100% on the X plane, so from one side of the box to the other.    
                </p> 
                
                <p>Transition is used in the "child" selector, and contains only "transform .25s;"". 
                    This makes it so that over .25 seconds the red square will transform over to the other side of the box. 
                    Very simple and effective! There are a bit more complex options you can use that only really effect the timing of the animation, 
                    but this property is limited by its lack of options.
                    Though this example is relatively simple, one can see how this could be useful for simple animations on stuff like buttons and menus.

                </p>
                
                <p>The more complex option for animation is the Animation property in CSS. 
                    This property has many more sub-properties: delay, direction, duration, fill-mode, iteration-count, name, play-state and timing-function. When using the animation
                    property you first have to name the animation. Once the animation is named you can determine what, where and when you want the animation to occur using key frames.
                    Keyframes are used outside of any selector using the @keyframes query. Keyframes are used by determining what the animation looks like between 0% and 100% complete.                
                </p>
                
                <p>In the animation below for example, I have it so the orange square moves down, then to the right, then back up, each time changing color. 
                    This animation is composed of 4 different keyframe states using the transform property. You can also change other properties within these states which is how I changed the color of the square. 
                    In this example I set it so that the animation only occurs when the cursor is hovered over the box, however if you were to change where the animation property is placed from the 
                    ".parent:hover child" selector to the ".child" selector, you could add "infinite" to the animation property to have the animation running forever, regardless of 
                    whether the box is being hovered over.
                </p>
                
                <p>Though this example is very simple, there are countless other ways to utilize the animation property. Check out some of the websites below to get more information 
                    about animating is CSS and how to create complex animations through code. Also check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YszONjKpgg4"> this video</a> for a quick tutorial on CSS animation
